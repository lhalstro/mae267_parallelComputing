\section{Statement of Problem}

This analysis details the solution of the steady-state temperature distribution on a 1m x 1m block of steel with Dirichlet boundary conditions (Eqn~\ref{dirichlet}).  Single-processor solutions were previously performed on a square, non-uniform grids rotatated in the positive z-direction by $rot=30^o$.  Two grids of 101x101 points and 501x501 points were used to solve the equation of heat transfer.  Temperature was uniformly initialized to a value of 3.5 and the solution was iterated until the maximum residual found was less than $1.0x10^{-5}$.  The equation for heat conduction (Eqn~\ref{heat}) was solved using an explicit, node-centered, finite-volume scheme, with an alternative distributive scheme for the second-derivative operator.  Steady-state temperature distribution was saved in a PLOT3D unformatted file, and CPU wall time of the solver was recorded.

Now, the code has been modified to decompose the domain into sub-domains refered to as blocks.  Boundary and neighbor information for each block is stored so that connectivity can be accurately assessed when communication between blocks is required.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Equations and Algorithms}

The solver developed for this analysis utilizes a finite-volume numerical solution method to solve the transient heat conduction equation (Eqn~\ref{heat}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =
    k \left[ \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}
    + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} \right]
\end{split}
\label{heat}
\end{equation}

\noindent The solution is initialized with the Dirichlet boundary conditions (Eqn~\ref{dirichlet}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
T = &\left\{ \begin{array}{lll}
    \mbox{$5.0 \left[ \sin\left( \pi x_p \right) + 1.0 \right]$} & \mbox{for } &j = j_{max} \\
    \mbox{$\left| \cos\left( \pi x_p \right)\right|+1.0$} & \mbox{for } &j = 0 \\
    \mbox{$3.0 y_p + 2.0$} & \mbox{for } &i = 0, \, i_{max}
     \end{array} \right.
\end{split}
\label{dirichlet}
\end{equation}

\noindent Grids were generated according to the following (Eqn~\ref{grideqn})

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
   rot &= 30.0 \frac{\pi}{180.0} \\
   x_p &= \cos \left[ 0.5\pi \frac{i_{max}-i}{i_{max}-1} \right] \\
   y_p &= \cos \left[ 0.5\pi \frac{j_{max}-j}{j_{max}-1} \right] \\
x(i,j) &= x_p \cos(rot) + (1.0 - y_p) \sin(rot) \\
y(i,j) &= y_p \cos(rot) + x_p \sin(rot)
\end{split}
\label{grideqn}
\end{equation}

\noindent To solve Eqn~\ref{heat} numerically, the equation is discretized according to a node-centered finite-volume scheme, where first-derivatives at the nodes are found using Green's theorem integrating around the secondary control volumes.  Trapezoidal, counter-clockwise integration for the first-derivative in the x-direction is achieved with Eqn~\ref{FVx1st}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{2Vol_{i+\frac{1}{2},j+\frac{1}{2}}}
    \left[ \left(T_{i+1,j} + T_{i+1,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i+1,j} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j} + T_{i,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i,j} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j+1} + T_{i+1,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i,j+1} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j} + T_{i+1,j} \right)Ayi_{i,j} \right]
\end{split}
\label{FVx1st}
\end{equation}

\noindent A similar scheme is used to find the first-derivative in the y-direction.

\section{Results and Discussion}

Both grids used in this analysis were non-uniformly distributed according to the same function and decomposed into 10x10 and 5x4 block systems.

Comparing the two grids, it can be seen that the block sizes for a given block decomposition are the same between the coarse and fine grid.  The fine grid, however, has many more points contained in each block than does the coarse grid.  It is also interesting to note that the edges of the grid that are most refined have the smallest blocks, and block size tends to decrease as a function of grid spacing.  This decrease in area is required, since blocks are constrained to contain the same number of points.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}

Decomposing the domain is the first step towards solving a computational grid with parallel computing.  Much more is still required, however, to create the complete infrastructure of such a solver.  In the next project, the block decomposition will be improved with multi-block solver running on a single processor.
